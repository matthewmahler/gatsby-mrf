        <p>
          My Rising Fall is a pop punk/melodic hardcore band based out of
          central NJ. Our upcoming ep "The Hate You Hold" is the result of hard
          work and experiences over the past 5 years (we wrote it in 5 days).
          over that period of time, we have evolved our sound into what we feel
          is the best representation of ourselves and our musical influences.
